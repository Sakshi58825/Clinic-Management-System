This is a modern and efficient Clinic Management System designed for small to medium-sized clinics. It streamlines and digitizes essential clinic operations such as patient registration, appointment scheduling, patient queue management, and prescription issuance. The system aims to significantly improve efficiency and convenience for administrators, doctors, and patients alike by providing a clear, role-based workflow.
How It Works (Role-Based Functionality):

The system is built with distinct user roles, each having specific functionalities to ensure a smooth and organized clinic workflow:
Administrator (Admin):
User Management: Admins possess the highest level of access. They can easily add new users (doctors, receptionists, other admins) to the system and assign/manage their respective roles.
System Oversight: Ensures the overall health, performance, and security of the system, managing core configurations and user permissions.
Receptionist:
Patient Registration: Efficiently registers new patients into the system, capturing essential demographic and contact information.
Appointment Booking: Seamlessly schedules appointments for patients with available doctors, managing time slots and doctor availability to optimize the clinic's schedule.
Patient Queue View: Monitors the overall patient queue, providing a comprehensive overview of patient flow within the clinic.
Doctor:
Assigned Patient Queue: Doctors see a personalized, filtered queue displaying only the patients assigned to them or those awaiting their consultation.
Consultation Management: Can initiate a consultation ("Start Consultation") for a patient and mark an appointment as "Completed" once the consultation concludes.
Patient Details View: Accesses detailed patient information, including medical history (if implemented), during consultations for informed decision-making.
Prescription Issuance: Utilizes a dedicated module to add new prescriptions for patients, specifying medication details, dosages, and including any relevant consultation notes.
Patient:
Self-Registration: Patients can securely register themselves into the system, creating their own profiles.
Appointment Booking: Has the convenience of booking their own appointments with preferred doctors based on availability.
(Future Scope/If Implemented): Securely view their appointment history and potentially access their past prescriptions.
Key Features:

Role-Based Access Control: Ensures secure and tailored access for Admin, Doctor, Receptionist, and Patient roles, enhancing data integrity and privacy.
Efficient Patient Flow Management: Streamlines the entire patient journey from initial registration to consultation completion, reducing wait times and improving patient satisfaction.
Digital Prescriptions: Eliminates paper-based prescriptions, ensuring clarity, easy retrieval, and accurate record-keeping.
Real-time Updates: Patient queues and appointment statuses are updated in real-time, providing immediate visibility to all relevant stakeholders.
User-Friendly Interface: Designed with an intuitive and clean interface for easy navigation and efficient operation by all user types.
Technologies Used:

Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
Backend & Database:
Firebase Authentication: For robust user authentication, identity management, and securing role-based access.
Firebase Realtime Database: Utilized for real-time data storage, synchronization, and managing all dynamic data including patient profiles, appointments, prescriptions, and user information.
Project Setup:

To set up and run this project on your local machine, follow these steps:
Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/ClinicManagementSystem.git
cd ClinicManagementSystem
(Replace YourUsername with your actual GitHub username)
Firebase Project Configuration:
Create a new project on the Firebase Console  .
Enable Firebase Realtime Database and Firebase Authentication for your project.
In your Firebase project settings, navigate to "Project settings" -> "Your apps" (web app icon), and copy your web app's configuration details (e.g., apiKey , authDomain , projectId , storageBucket , messagingSenderId , appId ).
Update the configuration details in the js/firebase.js file within this project to connect it to your Firebase backend.
Run Locally:
Serve the index.html file using a local web server. A simple way is to use the serve npm package (if you have Node.js installed):
npm install -g serve  # Install serve globally if you haven't already
serve .               # Run serve from your project's root directory
Open your web browser and navigate to the local server address (typically http://localhost:5000 or http://localhost:3000 ).
